The goal of the cotton plant disease prediction model is to determine the health status of a cotton plant based on images of its leaves and trees. The model classifies the images to determine whether the plant is affected by a disease or not. This is a multi-class classification problem.

In this project, I used the Inception V3 model pre-trained on ImageNet. Initially, I performed model fitting with this pre-trained model and achieved an accuracy of 90%. Then, I performed fine-tuning, which helped to increase the accuracy to 95%.
